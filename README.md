# -Predicting-Diabetes-from-Large-Imbalanced-Dataset
Diabetes, a chronic condition that raises blood sugar levels unnaturally,
is a global health concern at the moment. If an accurate prognosis can be made, the
risk factor and severity of diabetes can be greatly decreased. It is quite challenging
to make reliable and precise predictions about diabetes. However, despite advances
in machine learning, existing diabetes prediction studies frequently suffer from
limitations due to small dataset sizes and the failure to address class imbalance
issues, which can impede the development of accurate and reliable models, particularly for large-scale, real-world applications. These constraints make it difficult
to develop models that are both effective and dependable for practical, large-scale
deployment. In this project, a variety of balancing strategies and machine learning models have been used to present a thorough methodology for diabetes prediction.
This project aimed to develop a robust and accurate diabetes prediction model capable of handling class imbalance. the work starts with data preparation,
which includes encoding and normalisation, and then applies synthetic minority
over-sampling techniques like SMOTE, ADASYN, Borderline-SMOTE. By employing oversampling techniques SMOTE,
ADASYN and Borderline-SMOTE to address the class imbalance problem and implementing a diverse set of machine learning algorithms, including Decision Trees,
KNN, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, and XGBoost, the study
successfully achieved its objectives. Ensemble models, such as Bagging and Voting
Classifiers, were further explored to enhance prediction performance, leveraging
the combined strengths of multiple algorithms. A comprehensive evaluation of the
models was conducted using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score.
To gain a deeper understanding of model performance, visualization techniques
such as Confusion matrix, Line charts were employed. The results demonstrate
consistent and robust performance across both individual and ensemble models,
highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach in addressing the challenges
of diabetes prediction. This project contributes to the development of accurate
and reliable models for diagnosis and intervention, ultimately improving patient
outcomes.
